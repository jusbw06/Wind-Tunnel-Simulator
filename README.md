## Overview
For the final project, we created a wind tunnel simulation to model the effects of a fluid passing through a tighter area. The wind tunnel consists primarily of a 2 dimensional grid of pressure and velocity for each pixel. The pressure and velocity are mapped to a rgb color scale with blue being low values and red being higher. The user can interact with the simulation by using arrow keys to increase or decrease the width of the tunnel. The effects of this smaller area can be seen in both the pressure and velocity maps. Clicking on the simulation can be used to see the velocity and pressure at that location and to spawn particles.
